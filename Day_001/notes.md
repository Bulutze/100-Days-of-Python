## 📝 Day 1 - Working with Variables in Python to Manage Data  

📌 **Today I Learned:**  
Today, I explored the basics of working with variables in Python. Here are some key concepts I learned:  

🔹 **Using `\n` for New Lines**  
The `\n` character moves the cursor to a new line when printing text.  

**Example:**  
```python
print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator. \nWhat's the name of the city you grew up in?")
Welcome to the Band Name Generator.  
What's the name of the city you grew up in?
🔹 input() Function
The input() function allows user input, similar to Scanner in Java.

🔹 Adding Comments
Comments can be added using #.

🔹 Example Code: Getting User Input and Printing a Greeting
print("Hello " + input("What is your name?\n"))
Output:
hat is your name? Zeynep  
Hello Zeynep
🔹 Using len() Function
The len() function returns the length of a string or list.

I’ve added screenshots of my code execution.

🎯 Summary:
Now I understand how to take user input, print multiline strings, use comments, and calculate the length of strings!
