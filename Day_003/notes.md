ðŸ“Œ Today I Learned:
Today, I learned about control flow, logical operations, and shorthand conditions.

ðŸ”¹ Shorthand Conditional Expressions
Instead of writing:
if age >= 45 and age <= 55:
A simpler version is:
if 45 <= age <= 55:
ðŸ”¹ Escaping Characters in Strings
In Python, we can use \ (backslash) to escape special characters like quotes inside strings.

Example:
input("You're at a crossroad. Where do you want to go? \nType \"left\" or \"right\" ")
Output:
You're at a crossroad. Where do you want to go?  
Type "left" or "right"
ðŸ“¸ Screenshots
Iâ€™ve added screenshots of my code execution.

ðŸŽ¯ Summary:
Now I understand how to use logical operators, shorthand conditionals, and escape characters in strings!
