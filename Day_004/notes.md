# 📝 Day 4 - Python Random Library

## 📌 Today I Learned:
Today, I explored the **random** module in Python. Here are some key functions I learned:

### 🎲 `random.randint(a, b)`
- Generates a random integer between `a` and `b` (inclusive).
- Example:
  ```python
  import random
  print(random.randint(1, 10))  # Outputs a number between 1 and 10

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(random.choice(fruits))  # Randomly selects one fruit

🎯 Summary:
I can now generate random numbers and make random selections.
These functions are useful for games, simulations, and randomized decision-making.
