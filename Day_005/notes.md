📝 Day 5 - Python Loops  

📌 Today I Learned:  
Today, I explored loops in Python and how to use them efficiently. Here are some key concepts I learned:  

🔄 `range()` function  
- Used to generate a sequence of numbers in loops.  
- Example:  
  ```python
  for i in range(1, 6):  
      print(i)  # Prints numbers from 1 to 5  

🖇️ end="" Parameter

Helps control output formatting by preventing automatic new lines.
